# Lyric-Classification-NLP
This is my final project for Natural Language Processing
we were using text processing methods such as :
1. convert the string into a lowercase
2. remove special characters and punctuations
3. tokenization (removal of the stopwords)
4. stemming </br>

in this code, I want to classify the song genres based on the lyrics by the given dataset. </br>
The dataset contains 2 column which is the genre and the lyrics which after the lyrics have been cleaned then we do 2 kinds of classification :

1. linear regression
2. linear SVC

the purpose of those 2 were to compare which one have the best accuracy between the 2 linear classifiers
